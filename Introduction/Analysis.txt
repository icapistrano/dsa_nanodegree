Task0

Retrieving item by index in Python list is constant time. So, runtime for Task 0 is 
O(1) time complexity.

---------

Task1

Iterating through for loop in function unique_nums is linear. So, runtime for Task 1 
has worst case O(n) time complexity.

---------

Task2

Iterating through for loop of calls is linear. So, runtime for Task 2 has worst case 
O(n) time complexity.

---------

Task3

Iterating through each item in for loop fixed_line_callers_called is linear. Checking
if item is a phone number, fixed line or Telemarketer's number is constant time. 
Python's built-in function sorted which is an implementation of Timsort has a worst 
case O(n logn) time complexity.

---------

Task4

Similar to Task3, Python's built-in function sorted has a worst case of O(n logn) time
complexity.
