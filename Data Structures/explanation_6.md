# Problem 6: Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Finding the union of two linked-list takes linear time as we have to iterate through both linked-list to find unique node values. Space complexity is also linear where n is the total number unique node values.

Finding the intersection of two linked-list takes linear time as we have to iterate through both linked-list to find common node values. Space complexity is also linear where n is the total number of common and unique node values.

So, time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).
