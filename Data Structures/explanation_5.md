# Problem 5: Blockchain

As the problem only stated insertion of a node with reference to the previous node, I used a linked-list with a tail point for inserting a block into the blockchain at constant time.

Space complexity is linear where n is the number of nodes added into the blockchain.

So, time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(n).
